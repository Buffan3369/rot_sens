# Evaluating the influence of model choice on palaeogeographic reconstructions in Palaeobiology

Our goal is to assess the impact of using different rotation models while reconstructing the surface of the Earth deep in time for Palaebiological purposes. For that, we need to first quantify how different the available paleorotation models are. The second part of our project is be devoted to an illustration of these differences by applying the models to true fossil datasets (corals and terrestrial crocodylians).

## Assessing the differences between paleorotation models

Our approach consists of:

<ol>
  <li> Creating a 1x1Â° meshgrid
  <li> Opening it in Gplates
  <li> Merging it with continental polygons associated with a given model
  <li> Applying rotation to the resulting spatial data points
  <li> Extracting their coordinates over time
  <li> Comparing them between models
</ol>
